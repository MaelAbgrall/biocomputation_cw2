# Biologically inspired computation, coursework 2
Goal: implement a genetic algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and benchmark them on a sample of functions

#### note:
somehow, when evaluating a population with more than 1 sample, numpy library is giving multiple different results for the same duo of x, y
ex (Matyas): 
```
[ -5.  ,   8.  ,  42.34],
[ -5.  ,  -8.  ,   3.94]
```
